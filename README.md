# FestersQuest2.0
A rom hack changelog for an old game

## System Changes
1. Game no longer runs on NES and has a custom ground built engine as these changes require lots of tweaks and an overhaul to many systems that can't be done on NES hardware.
2. Save system has been implemented where you can quit and reload at any time.
3. NG+ is available after beating the game, you start with all upgrades and everything you had. Enemies do increased damage, new tiers of enemies appear everywhere, and bosses have new movesets to account for endgame character progression.
4. Checkpoints are set after every exit of a sewer section or entrance to a sewer section, if you die no longer do you restart to the beginning.

## Gameplay Changes
1. Gun shoots through walls at LV5 power and above
2. Enemy spawns are no longer set the way they were, now it is random and they can come from any available side of the screen. This makes wall tunnelers more dangerous and less frustrating to deal with as a side balance.
3. Health is no longer single point bars, the bars signify increments of 50HP.
4. Enemies do standard damage numbers towards HP, they can now do percentage of bar damage rather than a single bar always.
5. All bosses upon first viewing increase your max health by one bar (similar to Bloodborne boss insight) except on NG+.
6. All bosses upon defeat give an upgrade to the character and drop an attack up damage upgrade except on NG+.
7. All bosses upon defeat show a cutscene.
8. New bosses and a superboss exist in game.
9. New ACT after beating the UFO boss (Alien world).
10. TNT now destroys bombable overworld areas.
11. New status effects exist, Vice Grips work on all status effects.
12. 3D segments now in 3rd person and have more to view such as portraits of the Adam's family.
13. Extra buttons on controller can be used for Defend, Roll, and switch Gun/Whip when these upgrades are collected.

## Map Changes
1. Map is more complex
2. Pit at beginning is now a river, bridge is made across it when you beat the Ranger miniboss.
3. ACT 2: Alien World map exists after beating the UFO boss, the overworld is on an alien planet. The sewer section is a series of caves. 
4. Dead end at bottom of the first street is now open for a way to bypass the first area and major boss. Meant for speedrunners but not recommended as you lose out on early upgrades.
5. Shortcuts and bypasses are more common in the world map, the game is less linear and more like a metroidvania.
6. Secrets exist in bombable areas which require TNT.
7. Some areas require certain status effects to go through (such as mini).
8. Hospitals have been replaced with haunted houses, in keeping with Adam's Family theme.

## Enemy Changes
1. Certain enemies drop Vice Grips.
2. Enemies drop red gun downgrades far less often.
3. New enemies and bosses.
4. New enemy type Zombie, moves slowly but does lots of damage.
5. One zombie is next to the first hot dog stand and has a guaranteed drop of a super gun powerup. Doesn't respawn. This is meant to be a beginning anti-grind feature.
6. New enemy type Pork Butcher, moves slowly has a lot of health. Attacks with ranged attack.
7. New enemy type White Space Frog, shoots lightning out of mouth in 180 degree arc. Causes paralysis status effect.
8. New enemy type Cyan Space Frog, shoots ice projectile out of mouth. Causes freezing status effect.
